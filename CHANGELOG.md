# Changelog

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- Group Folder support: protect group folders by their internal ID (`/__groupfolders/N`) without requiring the admin to be a group member
- Admin panel: two-tab modal ("Group Folders" and "Custom Path") for adding protections; gracefully degrades to single form when the groupfolders app is not installed
- API endpoint `GET /api/groupfolders` listing all group folders with their protection status
- API endpoint `GET /api/status` now emits `/files/<mountPoint>` aliases for group folder paths so the web UI badge system can match them by visible name
- ProtectionPropertyPlugin: removes the `D` flag from `oc:permissions` for protected folders so the Nextcloud desktop client does not attempt deletion locally

### Changed
- Desktop sync recovery: on a blocked DELETE or MOVE, the server updates the node's ETag and mtime so the sync client detects the server state as "newer" and restores the folder instead of showing a permanent sync error
- Database migrations consolidated from versions 1–4 into a single clean migration (Version 2); existing installations are not affected
- App version bumped to 2.0.0

### Fixed
- Group folder path detection in ProtectionPlugin and ProtectionPropertyPlugin: DAV nodes backed by a group folder storage are now correctly resolved to `__groupfolders/N` by traversing the storage wrapper chain via `getWrapperStorage()` / `getFolderId()`
- Lock icon badge now appears on group folders in the web file browser (path alias fix in `/api/status`)
- COPY operations on group folders are now correctly blocked
